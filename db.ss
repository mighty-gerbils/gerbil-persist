;; User-level transactions on top of a single synchronous leveldb writebatch.
;;
;; This file defines transactional access to a simple key-value store.
;; All current transactions go into a current batch, that at one point is
;; triggered for commit. At that point, it will wait for current transactions
;; to all be closed while blocking any new transaction from being open.
;; Thus, transactions must always be short or there may be long delays,
;; deadlocks, and/or memory overflow. Also, we have only roll-forward and
;; not roll-back of transactions, and so they must use suitable mechanisms
;; for mutual exclusion and validation before to write anything to the database.
;;
;; Multiple threads can read the database with db-key? and db-get,
;; seeing the state before the current transaction batch,
;; and contribute to the current transaction with db-put! and db-delete!.
;; Transactions ensure that all updates made within the transaction are
;; included in a same atomic batch. A transaction is scheduled for commit
;; with close-transaction, and you can wait for its completion with
;; commit-transaction.
;;
;; with-tx is a no-op if there is already a (current-db-transaction); if not,
;; it opens a transaction, executes code while this transaction is the
;; (current-db-transaction), commit it at the end, and waits for commit.
;;
;; This code was ported from my OCaml library legilogic_lib,
;; though I did refactor and enhance the code as I ported it.
;; Notably, in the OCaml variant, every function was defined twice,
;; as a client half sending a request and some server spaghetti code
;; processing it, with some data in between and plenty of promises
;; to communicate (like Gerbil std/misc/completion, just separating the
;; post! and wait! capabilities). Instead, in Gerbil, I use locking
;; so functions can be defined only once, at the cost of having to
;; explicitly use the fields of a struct to share state instead of
;; just nicely scoped variables.
;;
;; Also, I added a timer for deferred triggering of batches by transaction.
;; I thought I had implemented that in OCaml, but that wasn't currently
;; in the master branch of legicash-facts. This is made necessary in Gambit,
;; because Gambit is lacking the OCaml feature allowing to run a FFI function
;; (in this case, the leveldb in parallel with other OCaml functions).
;; This parallelism in OCaml naturally allowed the workers to synchronize with
;; the speed of the batch commits, but that won't work on Gambit,
;; until we debug the Gambit SMP support.
;;
;; Final difference from OCaml, we use parameters for dynamic binding of the
;; database context, where OCaml could only use global variables, static binding,
;; and/or an explicit reader monad.
